//! Pallet for token migration from ERC-20 to Dock's native token. Migrators are assumed to not be adversarial
//! and not do DoS attacks on the chain and are the exchanges in practice. Migrators are given balance
//! by Dock to fulfil expected migration requests and Dock needs to ensure that migrators do hold the
//! correct amount of ERC-20 and that they will lock it (request signature from addresses to check ownership
//! and monitor addresses or ask them to transfer to the Vault). Also bonus amounts are calculated post
//! the initial migration and depend on the participating holder and their vesting choice which Dock
//! should verify with external migrators.
