//! This is a facade over Substrate's democracy pallet offering similar functionality with a few differences.
//! It also assumes that sending extrinsics to Substrate's democracy pallet are disallowed and this is configured in runtime/lib.rs
//! This pallet offers a "simple majority" governance, by mostly restricting certain features of Substrate's democracy pallet. Here only Council can vote but anyone can
//! propose by locking a fixed amount of tokens, `PublicProposalDeposit`. Similar to Substrate's governance pallet, both Council and
//! general public take turns proposing, and a proposal follows "propose" -> "referendum" -> "enact" sequence.
//! General public's proposals can be "seconded" by other token holder.
//! Technical committee can fast track proposal made by Council member.
//! A simple majority of Council members' votes (>50%) are needed to accept an ongoing referendum.
//! Council members can cancel a proposal made by the public.
//! Setting up of Council and Technical committee can be seen in the pallet's tests.
